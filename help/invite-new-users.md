# Invite new users

You can invite users to join your organization by sending out email invitations,
or creating reusable invitation links to share.

Prior to inviting users to your organization, it is recommended that administrators:

* Configure [default settings](/help/configure-default-new-user-settings) for
  new users.

* Configure the [organization language for automated messages and invitation
  emails][org-lang] for your organization.

When you invite users, you can:

* Set the [role](/help/user-roles) that they will have when
  they join.

* Configure which [channels](/help/introduction-to-channels) they will be
  subscribed to. The organization's [default
  channels](/help/set-default-channels-for-new-users) will be preselected.

* Configure which [groups](/help/user-groups) they will be added to.

Organization administrators can
[configure](/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations) who
is allowed to invite users to the organization. You will only see an **Invite
users** menu option if you have permission to invite users.

    **Note**: As an anti-spam measure, the number of email invitations
    you can send in a day is limited on the Zulip Cloud Free plan. If
    you hit the limit and need to invite more users, consider creating an
    [invitation link](#create-a-reusable-invitation-link) and sharing it
    with your users directly, or [contact support](/help/contact-support)
    to ask for a higher limit.

    **Warning**: When an account is created by accepting an email
